        <blockquote>
          After the completion of my bachelor's degree, I started working continuously for 8 years without taking any break. This sort of impacted my productivity and also harmed my work-life balance. Hence, I decided to take a break of 6 months to clear my mind, make amends with my family, and also do solo travel to different places. I also gained valuable lessons during this break such as the importance of work-life balance, organizational ability, and a fresh new perspective on life.

We upskilled ourselves, brought in more resources, and completed the product well in advance of the deadline. The higher management was proud, and our team was awarded in the quarterly town hall. It was a very proud moment for me.
